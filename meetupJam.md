The Creative Code Jam is a monthly gathering of artists, makers, designers, illustrators, coders, musicians, performers, learners and anyone interested in the use of computing skills for artistic expression. The event is free and open to all, regardless of age, origin, gender or experience. The jam is an opportunity to meet likeminded people and get creative together in a relaxed and safe environment. Beginners and first-timers should feel especially welcome!

**NOTE: Find the covid rules at the bottom.**

**NOTE 2: Due to construction, the space is currently only accessible via the temporary walkway located at Adalbertstr. 5-6 (next to the Kreuzberg Merkezi building). For a map and more detailed instructions, see https://co-up.de/about/ or watch [this video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ch7b7wbkxrt61if/howToGetToCoUp.mov?dl=0)**

SO WHAT'S GOING ON EXACTLY?
Participants are encouraged to team up and produce new work together. Our focus is on collaboration between disciplines, spontaneity and experimentation.

We sometimes propose exercises that foster creativity, collaboration as well as an exchange of skills between attendees.

The format is open and we like to keep it experimental so if you want to suggest an activity, please let us know! If it fits, we will make it happen :)

A NOTE ON DIVERSITY
We do our best to create a welcoming environment for all people regardless of race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, or genetics. People from group generally underrepresented in open-source, art, and technology fields are warmly encouraged to come by. And if you don't belong to an underrepresented group yourself, we kindly ask you to pause for a minute and think of a friend who does and would enjoy this meetup, and invite them to join... seriously, just stop reading and do it ðŸ™ˆ

SAFE SPACE POLICY
We support the Berlin Code of Conduct:

Please make sure you agree with its content.

ACCESSIBILITY
Co.up rooms are located on the third floor, so we will happily provide assistance with the elevator to those you if you need it. Please let us know in advance as there is an elevator key in the space. We're very sorry to say that co.up's bathrooms are not wheelchair accessible, but there are some accessible bathrooms nearby, including at the Wilhelm Liebknecht/Namik Kemal Bibliothek, MÃ¶bel Olfe, and SÃ¼dblock.

DO I NEED TO SPEAK GERMAN?
We speak mostly English so international guests are more than welcome! Our team also speaks French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish and German... though language availability may vary depending on which organizers are present :)
