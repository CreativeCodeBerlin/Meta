The Creative Code Stammtisch is an open conversation between artists, makers, designers, coders, performers, learners and anyone interested in the use of computing skills for artistic expression. The event is free and open to all, regardless of age, origin, gender or experience. Beginners and first-timers should feel especially welcome! You don't have to be a coder yourself ðŸ˜ƒ

**NOTE: The gate on the street may be locked -- in this case, get in touch with us so we can open it.**

WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT?
There is a time for people to present something if they want to, followed by informal discussions. Every topic is fair game, from net art to computational design and interactive installations all the way to wearable electronics and generative literature... It's a whole evening packed with fun, inspiration and human connection.

Join us on Friday and see for yourself, ask questions if you want, contribute with your comments and maybe show a project you're working on. We're looking forward to meet you all!

Note that this event is NOT just for coders! If you like art and/or technology, you will certainly enjoy yourself, and perhaps even learn something!

A NOTE ON DIVERSITY
We do our best to create a welcoming environment for all people regardless of race, ethnicity, color, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, or genetics. People from group generally underrepresented in open-source, art, and technology fields are warmly encouraged to come by. And if you don't belong to an underrepresented group yourself, we kindly ask you to pause for a minute and think of a friend who does and would enjoy this meetup, and invite them to join... seriously, just stop reading and do it ðŸ™ˆ

SAFE SPACE POLICY
We support the Berlin Code of Conduct:
berlincodeofconduct.org (http://berlincodeofconduct.org/)
Please read and make sure you agree with its content.

ACCESSIBILITY
Co.up rooms are located on the third floor, so we will happily provide assistance with the elevator to those you if you need it. Please let us know in advance as there is an elevator key in the space. We're very sorry to say that co.up's bathrooms are not wheelchair accessible, but there are some accessible bathrooms nearby, including at the Wilhelm Liebknecht/Namik Kemal Bibliothek, MÃ¶bel Olfe, and SÃ¼dblock.

DO I NEED TO SPEAK GERMAN?
We speak mostly English so international guests are more than welcome! Our team also speaks French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Finnish and German... though language availability may vary depending on which organizers are present :)
